## The crew

(TBA)

## Lyrics

### Gospel style spoken word

Have you ever been in a situation

Using open source software,

And you can’t work out how to run it?

Wouldn’t it feel real good to make a difference?

To make it right?

### Verse

As I open the manual

To do my task at hand,

I find it’s so hard to read.

It’s a mess, duplicates,

Ambiguities!

Who am I, to be blind, pretending that I can’t proofread?

### Pre-chorus

A website 404,

Then tweeting back and forth,

How to make that change?

My comments got lost in the backlog black hole

'Till I found the place to go,

And I found I wasn’t alone…

### Chorus

I’m starting with a fork of the repo.

I’m asking you to change the text.

The message gonna get so much clearer.

If you wanna make the docs a better place,

Checkout a branch, make a pull request.

_(second time with clapping and audience joins in, repeat ad infinitum)_

## Wishes for the future

~~Put the GitBook inside a Docker container and deploy on Kubernetes~~

Encourage similar efforts at other Write the Docks conferences!
